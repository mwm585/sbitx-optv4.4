v4.0 - 
FT8 Mode Improvements:
  - Both the local and web apps now display decorated messages in FT8 mode.
  - Callsigns: 
    - Callsigns logged are displayed in green.
    - Unlogged callsigns are displayed in red.
  - Grids: 
   - Logged grids are displayed in green.
   - Unlogged grids are displayed in yellow.
 - Band change: The console and web FT8 lists are cleared when changing bands.
 - At startup, two new SQLite indexes for FT8 lookups are created if missing.

Web App in FT8 Mode:
- A Robinson projection world map is displayed to the right of the FT8 lists (if the window is wide enough).
- Grid Display:
  - By default, grids seen during the current session are plotted on the map.
  - Logged grids are displayed in dark green, unlogged grids in yellow, and grids logged during the current session in red.
- Toggle Controls:
  - The "Seen" button toggles the plot on/off.
  - The "Logged" button toggles the display of all logged grids (in green) on/off.
- Map Controls:
  - Zoom using the slider or mouse wheel.
  - Change map position by dragging with the left mouse button.
  - Mouseover displays longitude, latitude, and grid information.
- Other UI Improvements:
  - The "SAVE" button has been renamed to "LOG" to reflect its function (opens the log tab).
  - Alt-click in FT8 lists opens a QRZ lookup window without starting a call.
  - The frequency field responds to the mouse wheel for adjustments.
  - New knob button added to show/hide the dial knob (instead of clicking the frequency field).
  - A new "Mute" button is available to mute sound (useful in FT8 mode).

CW Improvements:
- Modified and added "prosign" characters for TX.
- Decreased debounce to 800ms for CW spacing in TX.
- Decreased word delay for macros and keyboard CW operation.
- Reduced dash delay for a more natural CW sound.
- Fixed the Iambic B key sequence issue (from dash to dot).

UI and Other Improvements:
- FLDIGI Integration: Pitch controls can now be controlled externally by FLDIGI.
- Waterfall & Text Box:
  - Added fullscreen waterfall mode and the option to hide the text box for voice modes.
  - Changed the waterfall refresh speed for smoother operation in SSB.
- VFO Enhancements:
  - Added a VFO lock button in the menu and a corresponding indicator on the main screen. it can be toggled by the menu or a 
  long press of the VFO tuning knob

  - Shortened "digital mode" text to DIGI.
  - Added 8k display mode to the waterfall.
  - Removed the text box output for BFO adjustment.
- Recording: Fixed the duplicate recording stop function message.

- Sound Enhancements:
  - Optimizations to loopback receive process.
  - Optimizations to rx linearity.
- Other New Features:
  - Added a selectable RX notch filter to the main GUI.
  - Added a TCXO calibration option in the `hw_settings.ini` file.
